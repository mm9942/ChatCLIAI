# ChatCLIAI

A detailed, code-centric README is forthcoming. ChatCLIAI is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application that integrates OpenAI's GPT and FAISS, offering complete customization at the start of a chat session and the capability to save conversations to a database. Currently, it does not support chat continuation through loading from the database, and there are some known issues with loading documents and using it for the answers also isn't fully working. However, the chat functionality should operate as intended, although it has not been tested on Windows systems yet.
